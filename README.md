Java web application based on Jena using SPARQL and OWL reasoning

This is a prototype web application that is entirely coded in JSP pages and uses a Jena TDB persistent storage to store and query RDF data.

The application has been configured to run on Apache Tomcat server and depends on two files (OWL and RDF) in RDF/XML serialization. Jena 2.12.1 is a dependency.
